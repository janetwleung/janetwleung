# Hello World, I'm Janet Leung ðŸ‘‹

### I'm an Olympian turned Full-Stack Web Developer, looking to apply my new found love and knowledge for programming to make a positive impact on those around me.

After coming off a 4-year Olympic journey and a <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/softball/olympics-canada-mexico-softball-bronze-medal-july27-1.6118526?fbclid=IwAR0-2yVk22W2sCX2wy5rKTBkIUQi4pSZ5G4EfKP_nNKt13r0VjttCryNBEs">Bronze Medal performance</a> in Softball for Team Canada at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, I made the career transition by taking a coding bootcamp. The technical, analytical and creative aspects of web development drew me in and once I started learning the basics of HTML and CSS, I was hooked. I have achieved some of my biggest goals in sport and I attribute it to my work ethic and the value I hold in pursuing things that bring me joy, make me curious, and challenge me day after day. My passion for learning and constantly improving my craft has been one of the key successes to my life so far and I look forward to applying that same mindset to whatâ€™s next in my journey in the tech world.
